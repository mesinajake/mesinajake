## Hi there 👋

I'm currently working on AppliTrak: an AI-powered job portal that uses machine learning to match resumes with jobs in 30 seconds (instead of 5-7 minutes manually). Built with modern web technologies including React, Node.js, and MongoDB, featuring secure user authentication, document processing, and real-time analytics.

I'm looking to collaborate on meaningful projects where I can contribute my full-stack development skills, learn from experienced teams, and help build solutions that make a real impact.

I'm looking for help with landing a Software/Web/Frontend Developer internship where I can gain hands-on experience, receive mentorship, and work on real-world projects in a professional development environment.

I'm currently learning React.js, Next.js, and Express.js to build modern, fast, and scalable web applications. Actively expanding my skills through hands-on projects and exploring industry best practices.

Ask me about web development, building APIs, working with databases, or integrating AI into web apps. I enjoy discussing code solutions and learning from others!

Fun fact: I built an AI-powered app without expensive cloud services, proving creativity beats budget. Plus, I actually enjoy debugging—it's like solving puzzles!
